You will need a new or existing DatoCMS project to use this starter and will be asked for two API tokens (Full-access and Read-only) as well as the [environment][] during installation.
You can find your API tokens under the Settings > API tokens section of your project settings. The default settings should be correct, but make sure both Content Delivery API and Content Management API permissions are granted to these tokens. Additionally, by default your environment will be named "main".
