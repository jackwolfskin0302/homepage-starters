You will need a new or existing DatoCMS project to use this starter and will be asked for a Read-only API token as well as the [environment][] during installation.
You can find your API token under the Settings > API tokens section of your project settings. And Environment can be found under the Settings > Environments section. By default your environment will be named "main".
