You will need a new or existing DatoCMS project to use this starter and will be asked for a Full-access API token as well as the [environment][] during installation.
You can find your API token under the Settings > API tokens section of your project settings. The default settings should be correct, but make sure both Content Delivery API and Content Management API permissions are granted to the token. Additionally, by default your environment will be named "main".
