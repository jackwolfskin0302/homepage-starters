This repository uses the `gatsby-provision` convention to allow for automatic CMS content provisioning during the Deploy Now flow in Gatsby Cloud. After you Quick Connect Contentful to your site, you will be given the option to run the `gatsby-provision` script to populate the selected Contentful space with the site's associated content model and content.

Otherwise, you can always set up your content in Contentful manually before deploying to Gatsby Cloud.
