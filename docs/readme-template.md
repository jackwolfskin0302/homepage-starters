Create a homepage using Gatsby and :var[cms]. This starter demonstrates how to use :var[cms] to build a homepage and can be customized to match your own visual branding.

:link[demoURL]{text="View the Demo"}

## Quick start

::include{file=docs/quick-start-intro.md}

1. **Create a Gatsby site**

   Use the Gatsby CLI to get started locally:

   ```sh name
   npx gatsby new my-homepage https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-$-homepage
   ```

::include{file=docs/setup.md}

1. **Start developing**

   In your site directory, start the development server:

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

   Your site should now be running at <http://localhost:8000>

1. **Open the source code and start editing**

## Deploy your site

Once your content is available in :var[cms], deploy your site to [Gatsby Cloud](https://gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud):

1. Push your local site to a new repo in either GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
1. Log into your [Gatsby Cloud Dashboard][] and click on **Add a site**
1. Use the **Import from a Git repository** option to find your site
1. Add the environment variables from your `.env.production` file to Gatsby Cloud during setup
1. Click **Build site** and your site should start building

### Deploy without using the CLI

Alternatively, you can deploy this starter directly to Gatsby Cloud.
Note that you will need to set up your content in :var[cms] manually.

## How to

### Update the color theme

To update the colors used in this starter, edit the `src/colors.css.ts` file.

::include{file=src/colors.css.ts}

If you'd like to add additional colors, add additional keys to this object.
This file is imported into `src/theme.css.ts` and creates CSS custom properties, that can be imported and used in other `.css.ts` files.

The UI components file `src/components/ui.js` imports styles from `src/components/ui.css.ts`. You can see how the theme and color values are being used in this file.

### Add your logo

![Logo](./docs/images/logo.png)

Replace the `src/components/brand-logo.js` component with your own brand logo.
If you have an SVG version, it can be rendered inline as a React component, following the example in this file. Note that SVG attributes will need to be camel cased for JSX.

Using an inline SVG for the logo allows it to pick up the colors used in CSS, which is how the logo colors are inverted for the mobile menu.

If you prefer to use an image, use the [`StaticImage`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-plugin-image/#staticimage) component from `gatsby-plugin-image` in place of the SVG in this file.

### Customize headings, buttons, and other styles

![Headings & Buttons](./docs/images/headings-buttons.png)

To further customize the look and feel of the homepage, edit the UI components in `src/components/ui.js` and styles in `src/components/ui.css.ts`.

### Customize section components

To customize any of the sections of the homepage, edit the relevant component in `src/components`.
Most of the styles for these components are handled with shared UI components in `src/components/ui.js`.

### Create custom section components

To create a new type of section in your homepage, you'll want to create a new section component. Using the existing components as an example.
For this example, we'll create a new "Banner" component.

::include{file=docs/custom-sections.md}

1. Next, create the Banner component:

   ```jsx
   // src/components/banner.js
   import * as React from "react"
   import { graphql } from "gatsby"
   import { Section, Container, Heading, Text } from "./ui"

   export default function Banner(props) {
     return (
       <Section>
         <Container>
           <Heading>{props.heading}</Heading>
           <Text>{props.text}</Text>
         </Container>
       </Section>
     )
   }

   export const query = graphql`
     fragment HomepageBannerContent on HomepageBanner {
       id
       heading
       text
     }
   `
   ```

1. Export the component from `src/components/sections.js`

   ```js
   // src/components/sections.js
   export { default as HomepageHero } from "./hero"
   export { default as HomepageFeature } from "./feature"
   export { default as HomepageFeatureList } from "./feature-list"
   export { default as HomepageLogoList } from "./logo-list"
   export { default as HomepageBenefitList } from "./benefit-list"
   export { default as HomepageTestimonialList } from "./testimonial-list"
   export { default as HomepageStatList } from "./stat-list"
   export { default as HomepageCta } from "./cta"
   export { default as HomepageProductList } from "./product-list"

   // add export for new component
   export { default as HomepageBanner } from "./banner"
   ```

1. Add the GraphQL query fragment to the query in `src/pages/index.js`

   ```js
   // in src/pages/index.js
   export const query = graphql`
     {
       homepage {
         id
         title
         description
         image {
           id
           url
         }
         blocks: content {
           id
           blocktype
           ...HomepageHeroContent
           ...HomepageFeatureContent
           ...HomepageFeatureListContent
           ...HomepageCtaContent
           ...HomepageLogoListContent
           ...HomepageTestimonialListContent
           ...HomepageBenefitListContent
           ...HomepageStatListContent
           ...HomepageProductListContent
           # New component fragment
           ...HomepageBannerContent
         }
       }
     }
   `
   ```
